                <h2>Travel sketching in Australia</h2>
                <p>When I travel, I use a separate sketchbook to record places, buildings, plants, creatures and anything that stands out to me that I want to remember.  Sometimes I have time to sketch it in the moment, other times I sketch it later in the hotel or even back home.  I use Micron pens, graphite pencils and watercolor for most of my sketches with the occasional white gel pen or white acryla gouache if I’ve covered over some highlights.
                    This past June, my husband and I traveled to Australia before the 2019 GNSI (Guild of Natural Science Illustrators) conference I was to attend.  We flew in to Brisbane and stayed in a hotel across the street from the City Botanic Gardens.  The next day we drove up to O’Reilly’s Tree Canopy Walk in Lamington National Park, a subtropical rainforest.  I got in a sketch at the top of Moran Falls, a peaceful place that was backlit in the sun.  
                    Time got away from us and we were chasing the sunset all the way down the mountain which was challenging, considering we were driving on the opposite side than we were used to.
                    The next morning we spent some time at the Natural History Museum and I sketched some of the birds that I’d seen the day before.  My husband enjoyed the space exploration part of the museum.</p>
